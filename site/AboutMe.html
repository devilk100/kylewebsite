  <p>My name is Kyle and I am currently enrolled at Wake Technical Community College as a student. I am 18 years old and
    was born in New York. My family moved to North Carolina when I was young and I have spent most of my life here. At a
    very young age I have been facsinated by technology and how everything works and knew that I wanted to one day get a
    job that mostly uses technology. I enjoy spending my free time reading or messing with programs and video games.
    Initially, I wanted to continue my education after high school because I wanted to get into cybersecurity. However,
    those plans have changed after attending Web, Programming, and Database Foundations as cybersecurity isn't going to
    fill my curiousity on how the programs we use daily are made and how to create code of my own.</p>
  <p>What choices I will make in the future are unknown as my only goals at the moment are to attend school and to get a
    job so I can live by myself. I do not know what type of job I will be in the future but I feel like I am walking on
    the right path. Personality-wise I am a introverted person and I will not talk about my interests or ideas often.
    Quiet time is always desired when I am doing assignments or studying. Often times I find myself looking up random
    articles on Wikipedia or looking up books to read. Occasionally I roam the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet
      Archive</a> which is a website dedicated to preserving everything from books, videos, images, or even websites.
    History itself is a big interest for me as I enjoy seeing or reading things from the past and how things were before
    I was born.</p>
